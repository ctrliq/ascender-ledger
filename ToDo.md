# To Do

## Dashboard
- Add configurable dashboards based upon fact or other data

## Parser
- ~~Add setting so we only receive data from Trusted Servers~~

## Reports
- Add permissions (team)

## Changes
- Add permission on who can see changes (kinda hard to do this per host)
- Search filter should search on all words separately
- Save filters
- Add schedule for a report of new changes (email it out)

## Facts
- Add text search for fact data

## Users
- Add Teams
- ~~Invite New Users~~
- ~~New Users should be sent a token, which then locks them to Profile page until they change their password~~
